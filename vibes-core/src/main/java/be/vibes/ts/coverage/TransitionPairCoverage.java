 * Transition pair criteria for transition systems. The coverage criteria considers pairs of transitions
 * incoming and outgoing of the same state. The set of transition pairs to cover is the
 * set of pairs (incoming, outgoing) for each state in the transition system. A pair is considered covered by
 * a test if the execution of the test contains the sequence (incoming, outgoing). Note: if two transitions of a
 * pair to cover are executed but not one after the other, the pair is considered not covered by the test.
