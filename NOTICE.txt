NOTICE file for the VIBES Project
=================================

This project includes software originally developed at the University of Namur,
distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. This fork introduces
modifications to the original project to support updated architectures and functionality.

In 2025, substantial modifications were made by Sophie Fortz across several modules
to modernize the codebase, improve modularity, and support new data structures
such as those aligned with the UVL (Universal Variability Language) standard.

Below is a summary of key changes per module:

---

vibes-core
----------

- Refactored I/O classes to support updated feature model structures (see `vibes-fexpression`)
- Added support for reading and writing both TS and FTS models in DOT format
- Cleaned up code to align with modern Java standards

Note: The file `src/main/antlr4/be/vibes/ts/io/dot/DOT.g4` is licensed under the BSD license (Â© 2013 Terence Parr).
All other files are covered by the Apache License, Version 2.0.

---

vibes-fexpression
-----------------

- Major architectural overhaul of the feature model to better align with the UVL standard
- Clear separation of responsibilities between `SolverFacade` and `FeatureModel`
- Introduced support for hierarchical features and feature groups
- Improved I/O capabilities for feature models
- Cleanup of code to align with modern Java standards

These changes reflect substantial independent development while retaining aspects of the original structure.

---

vibes-dsl & vibes-selection
---------------------------

- Minor adjustments to support refactored feature model architecture (see `vibes-fexpression`)
- Code changes limited to integration and compatibility improvements
